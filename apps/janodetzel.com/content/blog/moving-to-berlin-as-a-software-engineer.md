Thinking about moving to Berlin as a software engineer? Berlin has become one of Europe's main tech hubs—but the reality in 2026 looks different from the hype of a decade ago. Here's a practical guide based on real experience: jobs, visas, cost of living, and what daily life is actually like.

## Why Berlin?

Berlin has become one of Europe's main tech hubs over the last decade. Compared to cities like London, Paris, or Zurich, it offers:

- A strong startup ecosystem
- English-speaking work environments
- Relatively lower cost of living (historically)
- A large international community

Companies range from early-stage startups to established scale-ups and global tech firms. You'll find product companies, fintechs, climate-tech startups, mobility players, and AI-driven SaaS businesses.

However, the "cheap Berlin" narrative is outdated. Housing is competitive, and bureaucracy remains slow.

## Job Market and Salaries

### Typical salary ranges (gross, per year)

- **Junior:** €45,000–€60,000
- **Mid-level:** €60,000–€80,000
- **Senior:** €75,000–€100,000+

Large international companies may exceed these numbers, while early-stage startups often compensate with equity.

### High-demand roles

- Backend (Node.js, Java, Go)
- Frontend (React, TypeScript)
- Mobile (React Native, Swift, Kotlin)
- DevOps / Platform Engineering
- AI / ML Engineering

Berlin's job market is international. Many roles do not require German. That said, speaking German significantly improves long-term integration and job mobility.

## Visa and Bureaucracy

If you are an EU citizen, relocation is straightforward.

If you are non-EU:

- You'll likely apply for the **EU Blue Card**.
- You need a job offer that meets minimum salary thresholds.
- You must register your address ("Anmeldung") quickly after moving.

Expect appointments to be difficult to book. Plan several weeks of buffer time.

### Documents typically required

- Signed work contract
- University degree recognition (if applicable)
- Rental contract
- Health insurance proof

## Cost of Living

### Rent (2026 reality check)

- 1-room apartment (inside Ring): €900–€1,400
- 2-room apartment: €1,200–€1,800

Competition is intense. Prepare documents in advance:

- SCHUFA (credit report)
- Salary statements
- Copy of passport
- No-debt certificate (if possible)

### Other monthly costs

- **Health insurance:** ~€250–€500 (public, income-dependent)
- **Groceries:** €250–€400
- **Public transport:** ~€49–€70
- **Internet + phone:** ~€40–€60

Net salary after taxes in Germany can surprise newcomers. Use a tax calculator before negotiating offers.

## What Daily Life Is Actually Like

Berlin is not polished. It's raw, creative, sometimes chaotic. That's part of its appeal.

**Pros:**

- Strong tech meetups and networking
- Vibrant cultural scene
- Flat hierarchies in many tech companies
- High English proficiency

**Cons:**

- Slow administration
- Housing pressure
- Weather (long grey winters)
- Fragmented public services

Work-life balance is generally good compared to US tech hubs. Overtime is less glorified, and paid vacation (usually 20–30 days) is standard.

## Practical Example: Estimating Net Salary

If you receive an offer of €75,000 gross annually:

```js
// Rough estimation (single, no children, public insurance)
const gross = 75000;
const estimatedNet = gross * 0.6;
console.log(estimatedNet); // ~€45,000 net annually
```

This translates to roughly €3,750 net per month. With €1,300 rent, you still have room to save—but not extravagantly.

Always calculate real net income before accepting an offer.

## Is Berlin Worth It?

It depends on your priorities.

**Move to Berlin if you want:**

- International exposure
- Startup experience
- Strong engineering communities
- A socially liberal, creative city

**Do not move if you expect:**

- Fast bureaucracy
- Cheap rent
- Swiss-level infrastructure
- Silicon Valley salaries

Berlin is a solid career accelerator for engineers early to mid-career. For late-career engineers optimizing purely for compensation, cities like Zurich or remote US roles may outperform Berlin financially.

## Conclusion

Berlin remains one of Europe's most accessible tech hubs. It offers meaningful career growth, strong communities, and international exposure—but you need realistic expectations about housing, taxes, and bureaucracy.

If you optimize for learning, network, and long-term EU mobility, Berlin is a strategic move.

If you optimize purely for after-tax income, evaluate alternatives carefully. For more on engineering, workflows, and building in Europe, check out the [blog](/blog).
