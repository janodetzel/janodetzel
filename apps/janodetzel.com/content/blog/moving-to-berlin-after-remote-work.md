## Working Remote for a Berlin Company

For two years, I worked fully remote as a software engineer for a Berlin-based company.

On paper, it was perfect. Interesting product. Smart team. Solid engineering culture. No commute.

I was living outside of Berlin, dialing into meetings, contributing to architecture discussions, shipping features, reviewing PRs. Technically, everything worked.

But something was missing.

## Remote Is Efficient — But It's Not Immersive

Remote work optimizes for productivity. It does not automatically optimize for exposure.

I realized that while I was growing technically, I wasn't fully plugged into the ecosystem. I wasn't bumping into founders at events. I wasn't having spontaneous whiteboard sessions after work. I wasn't building deep in-person relationships.

Slack and Zoom are functional. They are not substitutes for proximity.

Berlin isn't just an employer location. It's a density of ambitious people working on interesting problems.

After two years, I felt the gap.

## Why I Decided to Move to Berlin

I'm a German citizen, so relocation wasn't complicated from a legal perspective. The real question was strategic:

Would being physically in Berlin accelerate my growth?

I concluded: yes.

Not because of salary. Not because remote work failed. But because of opportunity surface area.

When you are in Berlin, you are closer to:

- Early-stage startups looking for technical co-founders
- Investors and operators building new companies
- Meetups and niche tech communities
- Side project collaborators
- Industry-specific events (AI, climate tech, fintech, mobility)

The number of "weak ties" you can create multiplies.

And weak ties create unexpected leverage.

## The Berlin Tech Ecosystem

Berlin has evolved into one of Europe's most important tech hubs.

Compared to cities like Munich, Hamburg, or even Amsterdam, Berlin has a different energy:

- More experimental
- More international
- More startup-driven
- Less corporate

You can attend multiple high-quality tech events per week. AI roundtables. Founder dinners. Demo days. Engineering meetups focused on specific stacks.

That density matters.

If you want to build something yourself one day, Berlin increases your probability of meeting the right people.

## Career Leverage Beyond the Job

When you live in Berlin, your job becomes only one part of the equation.

You can:

- Join a startup as an early engineer
- Explore advisory roles
- Collaborate on side projects
- Meet potential co-founders
- Transition into product or leadership roles faster

Remote work isolates you from serendipity.

Berlin increases serendipity.

For me, that was the deciding factor.

## What Actually Changed After Moving

The difference was immediate.

- Spontaneous after-work discussions became normal.
- Architecture debates continued over dinner.
- I got introduced to founders through colleagues.
- I attended events I would never have flown in for.

Your network compounds faster when you are physically present.

That alone justified the move.

## Was It Necessary?

No.

Remote would have continued to work.

But if your goal is to maximize exposure, long-term optionality, and real-world connections — proximity still wins.

For me, moving to Berlin wasn't about fixing a problem.

It was about increasing the upside.

## Conclusion

Working remotely for a Berlin company gave me flexibility and focus.

Moving to Berlin gave me leverage.

If you are early or mid-career and ambitious, the city offers something remote cannot fully replicate: density of opportunity.

And over time, that density compounds. For more on career, engineering, and building in Europe, check out the [blog](/blog).
