We're moving to Berlin, and like many people settling into a new city, we're turning to IKEA to furnish our place. Berlin has several IKEA stores — Tempelhof, Spandau, Lichtenberg, and Kaulsdorf — so you're never too far from flat-pack heaven. Here's what we've learned and what we're picking up.

## Why IKEA for a Berlin Move

Moving to a new city is already expensive. IKEA offers predictable pricing, quick availability, and furniture that fits typical Berlin apartments: compact, modular, and easy to adapt. Whether you're in a shared WG, a small Altbau, or a newer building, there's usually something that works.

## Essentials We're Getting

- **MALM** — The classic bedroom set. Sturdy, simple, and easy to assemble. We're going with the bed frame and a couple of nightstands for a consistent look.

- **KALLAX** — Unbeatable for storage. Use it as a room divider, bookshelf, or media unit. You can add drawers and doors later when you need them.

- **LACK** — Affordable side tables and TV stands. Not the most durable long-term, but great for getting set up quickly without breaking the bank.

- **POÄNG** — A comfortable armchair that doesn't take up much space. Perfect for small Berlin living rooms.

- **BESTÅ** — For the TV and media setup. Modular, so you can start small and expand. Fits well in most Wohnzimmer layouts.

## Berlin-Specific Tips

**Delivery:** IKEA Berlin stores can get crowded, especially on weekends. Consider ordering online for delivery — it often saves time and stress, and Berlin traffic can make pick-up runs tedious.

**Assembly:** If you're in a WG or know others who just moved, team up. Assembling IKEA furniture is faster with two people, and it's a good way to meet neighbours.

**Second-Hand First:** Before buying everything new, check Kleinanzeigen (formerly eBay Kleinanzeigen). Berlin has a huge second-hand market. People leave the city all the time and sell IKEA pieces for cheap. You can often find MALM, KALLAX, and POÄNG in good condition — just make sure you have a way to transport them.

**Measure Your Doors:** Altbau apartments in Berlin often have narrow stairwells and doors. Check the dimensions before you order larger items. IKEA's flat-pack design helps, but a PAX wardrobe can still be tricky in some buildings.

## What We're Skipping

- **Big sofas** — We're waiting until we know the layout of our new place. A POÄNG or two and a LACK table work for the first few weeks.

- **Heavy dining sets** — A simple table and folding chairs are enough to start. We can upgrade once we're settled.

## The Plan

Start with the basics: a bed, something to sit on, a table, and storage. Add pieces as you figure out how you actually use the space. Berlin apartments can be quirky — odd corners, high ceilings, uneven walls — so it pays to live in the space a bit before committing to big furniture decisions.

If you're also moving to Berlin soon, good luck with the move. And if you see someone carrying a KALLAX up five flights of an Altbau staircase, it might be us.
